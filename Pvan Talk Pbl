he asked to get  flight details based on some airlines

he asked us to create a fare matrix based on date of booking and the time of booking

asked us to plot a fares based on date of booking and days left for journey(time and date of booking)

the random seed or the function u choose is also importnat it should also capture the pattern of the logical fares

then use a classifier to create classes based on airline companies which increase price aggresilvely 

it should also include that criteria that if difference between date of journey and date of booking is 30 days also look on that issue this is 
during which motnh(like wether it is during june-july or november)

based on majority of companies in this class u try to figure out which company is bad in price rising


if possible 
    suggest a better date or hour...
